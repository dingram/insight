 - Add attribute lists (i.e. you can see which attributes are applied to a file)
 - mkdir() is ugly and seems to be broken
 - rmdir() may also be broken
 - Implement NOT query parsing and generation
 - Note: if the top level of a query tree has negation flag set, it's equivalent to (ALL_FILES AND NOT (query))
 - Directory synonyms
 - OR with (say) branch 2 negated = (b1 OR (ALL_FILES AND NOT b2)
 - Fix memory leaks
