 - Add attribute lists (i.e. you can see which attributes are applied to a file)
 - mkdir() is ugly and seems to be broken
 - rmdir() may also be broken
 - Implement NOT query parsing and generation
 - Note: if the top level of a query tree has negation flag set, it's equivalent to (ALL_FILES AND NOT (query))
 - Directory synonyms
 - OR with (say) branch 2 negated = (b1 OR (ALL_FILES AND NOT b2)
 - Lossless set intersect
 - Seperate attribute tree for auto-applied attributes without limbo removal
 - All inodes should be in inode tree until removed from file system... but keep limbo list
 - Reduce strdup() calls
 - Convert strsplit() to strsplitmap() wherever possible; and strsplitmap() to a set of macros()
 - Try to communicate information wherever possible (e.g. reduce strlen() calls)
 - Const-correctness; use type const * const var as appropriate, rather than const type * var
 - Fix memory leaks
